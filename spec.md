We'd like you to build a small RESTful chat API. The service should allow users to have conversations with each other.

An authentication layer is not necessary.

At a minimum, the program allows a user to message another user and output​s​ a log of each of their conversations.

Please persist the messages however you deem fit. Choice of programming language, tools, etc is entirely up to you.

We're looking to use this example as a way to understand how you think about writing software. In particular we're looking for:
- Whether the example works in the way we described.
- How you think about ensuring your code works properly.
- How you think about structure and design.
- Code cleanliness, naming,​ and ​style.
- ​Technical prowess. (I.e., ​a scaffolded Rails ​a​pp​ does not best portray your abilities​)
